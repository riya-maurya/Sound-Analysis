# Sound Analysis using Data Science

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sound data using data science techniques. The goal is to process, visualize, and extract meaningful insights from audio data using various machine learning and signal processing techniques.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Loading and cleaning audio data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting key features such as MFCCs, spectral features, and more.
- **Visualization:** Plotting waveforms, spectrograms, and feature distributions.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Applying models for classification or regression tasks on audio data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Librosa (for audio analysis)
- Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Sound_analysis.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to process and analyze the sound data.

## Dataset
- The project uses audio datasets that can be loaded from local files or external sources.
- Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory before running the notebook.

## Results
- The analysis provides insights into sound characteristics.
- The models predict/classify based on extracted features.
- Graphs and charts visualize the data trends.
